Run the game in Debug mode each time you want the game to compile any changes you make to the Plugins here.
Run the "Debug Game.bat" for basic Debug, or "Debug Game with Compile.bat" if you also want to compile changes to PBS files.
If doing this still doesn't seem to be doing anything, try deleting PluginScripts.rxdata in the Data folder.

When making a new mod, start from the MOD TEMPLATE folder.

If making PBS changes, consider using the PBS Extensons feature!
If you place a PBS file (e.g. “pokemon.txt”) inside a plugin, it will be hot loaded at runtime. This only works for defining new content, and will not work for trying to edit existing content.
This currently supports:
pokemon.txt
pokemon_metrics.txt
avatars.txt
abilities.txt
moves.txt
items.txt
regionaldexes.txt
trainers.txt
trainertypes.txt
metadata.txt

Examples of using each can be found in the MOD TEMPLATE folder.
