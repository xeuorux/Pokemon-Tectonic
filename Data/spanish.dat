If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world."`Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit."iThe tombs were reinforced, of course â€“ just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers."KGigasâ€™s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together."_I donâ€™t know.

Las obtuve â€“ Â¿QuiÃ©n podrÃ­a decirme que no con un Regidrago a mi lado?"\Por no mencionar el poderÃ­o del Team Chasm, porque mi investigaciÃ³n era MUY rentable."VEstaba llegando a eso, pero tambiÃ©n, hey, podrÃ­as ser Ãºtil algÃºn dÃ­a, Â¿SÃ­?"AComo estaba diciendo: encontramos a los cinco Regis menores."XMe tomÃ³ aÃ±os, pero decifrÃ© sus inscripciones y entendÃ­ su verdadera naturaleza."eEso nos llevÃ³ a Regigigas, y a ese punto estabamos abarcando mÃ¡s de lo que podÃ­amos sostener."[Gigas era mÃ¡s poderoso que el resto de los Regis juntos, y tambiÃ©n mÃ¡s inteligente."{Moldear la tierra, revertirla a un tipo de arcilla primigenia. Crear sellos y guardias a los que nada podrÃ­a atravesarlos."2Y, claro, podÃ­a usar un potente Gigaimpacto."jTambiÃ©n podÃ­a hacerâ€¦ otras cosas. Encontramos una manera de crear PokÃ©mon etÃ©reos con su poder."=Eran hostiles, poderosos â€“ tenÃ­an que ser encerrados."…Y para el momento en el que Yezera pateÃ³ nuestra puerta y nos dijo que paremos, estaba bÃ¡sicamente confirmando lo que ya sabÃ­amos."sEstabamos jugando con fuego. Si seguÃ­amos usando a Regigigas, corrÃ­amos el real riesgo de destruir el mundo."qO al menos permanentemente cambiarlo. AsÃ­ que pusimos a cada Regi de vuelta a su tumba y fuimos legÃ­timos."kLas tumbas fueron reforzadas, por supuesto â€“ nada puede atravesar las cÃ¡maras de los Regis menores."RLa cÃ¡mara de Gigas sÃ³lo puede ser abierta por los otros cinco Regis juntos."\No lo sÃ©. Ella estaba de acuerdo: era muy peligroso. Ã‰ramos criminales, no lunaticos."KSÃ© que las cosasâ€¦ no han ido bien con ella, Â¿Pero esto? Es insano."iQuiÃ©n sabe. SabÃ­amos que lagunos grupos estaban intentando recuperarlos â€“ siempre lo han estado."UÂ¿Pero lograrlo? No habÃ­a forma. Imposible. Peroâ€¦ aparentemente Yezera puede."3â€¦Probablemente. Puede que ya lo hayan hecho."dPero la cÃ¡mara de Gigas estÃ¡ en lo profundo, y si no han roto el sello aÃºn, serÃ­a por nada."[O si la han vuelto a sellar. Puedo intentar ir y comprobarlo, peroâ€¦ no prometo nada."VMi PUNTO es que si no ayudas, mejor que te acostumbres a ver sÃ³lo piedra blanca.">Vas a ver mucho de eso si alguien deja libre a Regigigas."4Escucha, no lo sÃ©. No sÃ© un montÃ³n de cosas."…AsÃ­ que dÃ©jame hablar con Andris, nuestros rangers, Helena, a quiÃ©n sea que pueda encontrar. Ya veremos quÃ© mal estÃ¡n las cosas."XY si esos ladrones muestran sus caras arriba del suelo, puedes enfrentarte a ellos."€Tienen por lo menos un Regi, probablemente mÃ¡s, asÃ­ que hay una fuerte tentaciÃ³n para sembrar el caso. Creeme â€“ lo sabrÃ­a."HOdio decir esto, pero tienes que continuar siendo tÃº mismo, chico."DO, no, no deberÃ­a llamarte chico. Toma esto â€“ te lo ganaste."USolÃ­amos darle estos a los equipos de asalto Chasm, para investigar las cuevas."UPodrÃ¡s llegar a cualquier parte de la regiÃ³n â€“ nadie se esconde de ti ahora."=AsÃ­ que consigue esas medallas y salva el dÃ­a, hÃ©roe."Â¿QuiÃ©n eres?"Â¿Por quÃ© haces esto?"CÃ¡llate, edgelord."Â¿QuiÃ©n era?"Â¿QuÃ© es lo que quieren?"Â¿Por quÃ© Yezera?"No es mi problema."Â¿QuerÃ­as poder?"Â¿QuerÃ­as dinero?"Â¿QuerÃ­as conocimiento?"$Â¿Por quÃ© deberÃ­a importarme?"

Besides that, Iâ€™m masked for a reason."iI would ask who you are, but quite frankly it doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™m going to find out soon enough."9Thereâ€™s only so many types of people in the world.":I just told you: because humiliating you will be fun."MUnless you mean extracting Regidrago, in which case, no, I wonâ€™t tell."bHumans have this infuriatingly self-destructive need to tell secrets. Iâ€™m better than that."3Well, I see the dialogueâ€™s broken down fast."Fine. Suffer."6But I didnâ€™t come here to engage in small talk."iI assure you, it isnâ€™t personal â€“ no one has anything interesting to say. Youâ€™re no exception."WBut you are exceptionally skilled, I understand, and thatâ€™s correlated with ego."5Allow me to show you what youâ€™re really worth."Vâ€¦Ah, so be it. I doubt I could drill humility through your thick skull anyways."=Youâ€™re good at playing shallow games â€“ good for you."1A Totem calls. Iâ€™ve seen more than enough."hThey got away. They won. A few that were masked, including whoever the hell THAT was. And Yezera..."UWish I knew. That guy was a narcissist and an asshole, I can tell you that much."#The rest of themâ€¦ who knows."Could be anything."jBut if they were after Regidrago specifically, and Yezeraâ€™s with themâ€¦ maybe even leading themâ€¦"4â€¦I donâ€™t know. It doesnâ€™t make any sense.">She should be the last person to pull this kind of stunt."XIt is. Itâ€™s your problem now, and I know you arenâ€™t gonna like that, but it is."5This is bigger than just one legendary PokÃ©mon."7Iâ€™m gonna let you in on the big open secret, OK?"oThe caves around Makya are tombs for the Regis. The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this."NWell, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back."yAnd then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that."{We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists."nâ€¦Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime."QMe, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone."jI had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didnâ€™t, so I got to study what I damn well pleased."LSome of us. I didnâ€™t. I had five Regis â€“ what did I need money for?"8If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena."GI lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life."oI just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.")You make it sound so pure and noble."bI was curious. Wanted answers. I got them â€“ who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?"YNot to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable."QIâ€™m getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?"5As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis."\It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature."JThat led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas."RGigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too."|Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through."2And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact."iIt could doâ€¦ other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal PokÃ©mon with its power.";They were hostile, powerful â€“ had to be locked away."}And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew."pWe were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world."`Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit."iThe tombs were reinforced, of course â€“ just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers."KGigasâ€™s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together."_I donâ€™t know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics."MI know thingsâ€¦ havenâ€™t been great for her, but this? This is insane."[Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back â€“ they always have been."PBut succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. Butâ€¦ apparently Yezera can."*â€¦Probably. They might already have."nGigasâ€™s chamber is deep down, though, and if they havenâ€™t broken the seal yet, itâ€™d be for nothing."QOr if theyâ€™ve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, butâ€¦ no promises."^My POINT is that if you donâ€™t help out, you better get used to the look of white stone."]Youâ€™re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose."<Listen, I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know a lot of things."sSo let me talk to Andris, our rangers, Helena, whoever else I can find. Weâ€™ll figure out how bad things are."PAnd if these thieves show their faces aboveground, you can brawl with them."~Theyâ€™ve got at least one Regi, probably more, so thereâ€™s a strong temptation to wreak havoc. Trust me â€“ Iâ€™d know."JHate to say it, but you just need to keep being your usual self, kid."JOr, no, I shouldnâ€™t call you kid. Take this â€“ youâ€™ve earned it."AUsed to give these to Chasm strike teams, for cave scouting."UItâ€™ll get you just about anywhere in the region â€“ nobody hides from you now."3So go get those badges and save the day, hero."Who are you?"Why are you doing this?"Shut up, edgelord."Who are they?"What do they want?"Why Yezera?"Not my problem."You wanted power?"You wanted money?"You wanted knowledge?"Why should I care?"Then why is Yezera..."How many Regis are stolen?"They're opening that door."Your point?"bThey got away.

Hay una semilla en su espalda. Al absorber los rayos del sol, la semilla crece progresivamente."’Para sostener su bulbo, sus patas crecen fuertes. Si pasa mÃ¡s tiempo tumbado a la luz del sol, el capullo pronto se convertirÃ¡ en una gran flor."˜Se dice que la flor de Venusaur adquiere colores vivos si recibe mucha nutriciÃ³n y luz solar. El aroma de la flor alivia las emociones de las personas."™La llama que arde en la punta de su cola es una indicaciÃ³n de sus emociones. La llama oscila cuando Charmander estÃ¡ feliz y arde cuando estÃ¡ enfadado."•Sus afiladas garras destruyen a los enemigos. Si se encuentra con un enemigo fuerte, se agita y la llama de su cola adquiere un color blanco azulado."ŒVuela en busca de oponentes fuertes. Exhala llamas intensas que pueden derretir cualquier material. Nunca quemarÃ¡ a un enemigo mÃ¡s dÃ©bil."Su caparazÃ³n no es solo para protecciÃ³n. Su forma redondeada y las ranuras minimizan la resistencia en el agua, lo que le permite nadar a altas velocidades."Su gran cola estÃ¡ cubierta con un pelaje rico y espeso. Los rasguÃ±os en su caparazÃ³n son evidencia de su dureza  en combate."œLas trombas de agua que sobresalen de su caparazÃ³n son muy precisas. Sus balas de agua pueden clavar con precisiÃ³n latas a mÃ¡s de 48 metros de distancia."ƒSu apetito voraz lo obliga a devorar hojas mÃ¡s grandes que Ã©l sin dudarlo. Desprende un olor terriblemente fuerte de sus antenas."™Su caparazÃ³n es tan duro como una losa de hierro. No se mueve mucho porque estÃ¡ preparando sus suaves entraÃ±as para evolucionar dentro del caparazÃ³n."ŒTiene una habilidad superior para buscar miel de las flores. Puede buscar, extraer y transportar miel a mÃ¡s de 10 kilÃ³metros de distancia."’Tiene un sentido del olfato extremadamente agudo. Distingue sus tipos de hojas favoritas de las que no le gustan olfateÃ¡ndolas con su gran nariz."•Permanece inmÃ³vil mientras se aferra a un Ã¡rbol. Sin embargo, se prepara para la evoluciÃ³n. Esto es evidente por lo caliente que es su caparazÃ³n."‘Un Beedrill es extremadamente territorial. Por razones de seguridad, nadie debe acercarse nunca a su nido. Si se enfada, atacarÃ¡ en un enjambre."–Tiene un sentido de la orientaciÃ³n muy agudo. Puede regresar a casa a su nido infaliblemente, sin importar lo lejos que estÃ© de su entorno familiar."Vuela patrullando su gran territorio. Si se viola su espacio vital, no muestra piedad al castigar a fondo al enemigo con sus afiladas garras."Este PokÃ©mon tiene unas plumas preciosas. Muchos Entrenadores quedan tan cautivados por las plumas de su cabeza que lo eligen como su PokÃ©mon."’Es extremadamente cauteloso. Incluso cuando estÃ¡ dormido, mueve constantemente las orejas y escucha el peligro. HarÃ¡ su nido en cualquier lugar."ŒSus robustos colmillos crecen constantemente. Para mantenerlos firmes, roe rocas y troncos. Incluso puede masticar las paredes de las casas."šSu grito se puede escuchar a mÃ¡s de 8 Km. Si su agudo grito se escucha resonando por todas partes, es una seÃ±al de que estÃ¡n advirtiendo de un peligro."šSu cuello largo y pico alargado son ideales para atrapar presas en el suelo o el agua. Mueve hÃ¡bilmente este pico alargado y delgado para atrapar presas."šSe enrosca en espiral mientras descansa. Esta posiciÃ³n le permite responder rÃ¡pidamente a un enemigo desde cualquier direcciÃ³n con la cabeza levantada."–Tiene un poder de constricciÃ³n muy fuerte. Incluso puede aplastar bidones de acero. Una vez se enrosca alrededor de su enemigo, escapar es imposible."—Almacena electricidad en las bolsas de sus mejillas. Cuando libera energÃ­a reprimida en un estallido, la energÃ­a elÃ©ctrica es igual a la de un rayo."”Si almacena demasiada electricidad, su comportamiento se vuelve agresivo. Para evitarlo, de vez en cuando descarga el exceso de energÃ­a y se calma."Cuando se enrosca en una bola, hace que cualquier ataque rebote sin causar daÃ±o. Su piel se ha vuelto dura y sÃ³lida al vivir en el desierto."›Se enrosca en una bola para protegerse de los ataques enemigos. TambiÃ©n para evitar un golpe de calor durante el dÃ­a cuando las temperaturas suben mucho."•Se cree que sus pÃºas altamente tÃ³xicas se desarrollaron como protecciÃ³n de su pequeÃ±o cuerpo. Cuando se enfurece, libera una toxina de su cuerno."ˆCuando estÃ¡ con sus amigos o familiares, sus pÃºas se guardan para evitar lesiones. Parece ponerse nervioso si se separa de los demÃ¡s."“Es experto en enviar a los enemigos por los aires con duros placajes usando su cuerpo duro y escamoso. Es mÃ¡s fuerte cuando defiende a sus crÃ­as."Ha desarrollado mÃºsculos que mueven libremente sus orejas en cualquier direcciÃ³n. Incluso el mÃ¡s mÃ­nimo sonido no escapa a la atenciÃ³n de este PokÃ©mon."Su cuerno es mÃ¡s duro que un diamante. Si detecta una presencia hostil, todas las pÃºas de su espalda se erizan a la vez y desafÃ­a a su rival."™Su cola gruesa contiene un poder destructivo capaz de derribar una torre de transmisiÃ³n de metal. Una vez que se vuelve loco, no hay forma de detenerlo."’Todas las noches de luna llena, salen a jugar. Cuando llega el amanecer, se van a dormir acurrucados unos contra otros en las montaÃ±as profundas."œUsa sus alas para dar saltitos como si estuviera volando. Su paso le permite incluso caminar sobre el agua. En las noches tranquilas se pasea por los lagos."’Al momento de su nacimiento, tiene una cola blanca. Se separa en seis si este PokÃ©mon recibe mucho amor. Las seis colas se rizan magnÃ­ficamente."›Durante mucho tiempo se ha dicho que cada una de las nueve colas encarna un poder encantado. Un Ninetales longevo tendrÃ¡ un pelaje que brilla como el oro."Todos se quedan dormidos al oir su canciÃ³n. Las ondas de su voz cantando coinciden con las ondas cerebrales de alguien en un sueÃ±o profundo."Su pelaje es lo Ãºltimo en lujo. Dormir junto a un Wigglytuff es simplemente divino. Su cuerpo se expande aparentemente sin fin cuando inhala."™Mientras vivÃ­an en oscuras cavernas, sus ojos se cerraron gradualmente y los privaron de la visiÃ³n. Usan ondas ultrasÃ³nicas para detectar obstÃ¡culos."šSus colmillos perforan incluso la piel gruesa. Le encanta darse un festÃ­n con la sangre de su vÃ­ctima. Revolotea en la oscuridad y ataca por la espalda."Crece absorbiendo la luz de la luna. Durante el dÃ­a, se entierra, dejando solo sus hojas expuestas para evitar que sus enemigos lo detecten."’Una miel muy nociva sale de su boca. Un poco puede provocar pÃ©rdida de memoria. Se dice que algunos fanÃ¡ticos disfrutan de este hedor abrumador."–En las estaciones en las que produce mÃ¡s polen, el aire a su alrededor se vuelve amarillo con el polvo al caminar. Es muy tÃ³xico y causa parÃ¡lisis."‰Un Paras tiene hongos tochukaso parÃ¡sitos que crecen en su espalda. Crecen extrayendo nutrientes del huÃ©sped. Se valoran como medicina."šInfestan las raÃ­ces de los Ã¡rboles grandes en masa y drenan los nutrientes. Cuando un Ã¡rbol infestado muere, se trasladan a otro Ã¡rbol todos a la vez."Su capa de pelo fino y rÃ­gido que cubre todo su cuerpo ha evolucionado para protegerse. Sus grandes ojos detectan hasta las presas minÃºsculas."‡Son nocturnos, solo estÃ¡n activas durante la noche. Su presa favorita son los insectos alrededor de las farolas, atraÃ­dos por la luz."Se crÃ­an en la mayorÃ­a de las granjas. La razÃ³n es simple: dondequiera que caven, la tierra queda perfectamente labrada para cultivar deliciosas cosechas."–Debido a que los trillizos originalmente se separaron de un solo cuerpo, piensan exactamente igual. Trabajan en cooperaciÃ³n para excavar en el suelo."Retrae sus afiladas garras en sus patas para escapar en silencio.

Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"¥Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"«Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single PokÃ©mon, but many can target multiple PokÃ©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different PokÃ©mon based on those PokÃ©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"Learning Moves"ŠPokÃ©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every PokÃ©Center."Base Power"Moves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."Power Points"ŠPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a PokÃ©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."—Each PokÃ©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a PokÃ©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A PokÃ©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a PokÃ©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"ŠHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"’Barely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"¯Ineffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a PokÃ©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"‘The 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that PokÃ©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Why Get More?"Having choices of PokÃ©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"‹The two main methods of acquiring PokÃ©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"®Wild PokÃ©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these PokÃ©mon by throwing PokÃ© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"›Catching a PokÃ©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch PokÃ©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a PokÃ©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the PokÃ© Ball menu."Finding Wild PokÃ©mon"ªUse the DexNav to get information on which PokÃ©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more PokÃ©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"Throughout the world there will be people offering trades for PokÃ©mon. Usually they want a different PokÃ©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your PokÃ©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"ŠCheck your PokÃ©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the PokÃ©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"˜Your PokÃ©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"­Every species of PokÃ©mon have base stats, which affect every PokÃ©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"”Style Points are numbers which you can customize to change your PokÃ©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"…Your PokÃ©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When PokÃ©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"Stat Steps"“Effects can modify a PokÃ©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the PokÃ©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"Stat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the PokÃ©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"œYou can check the current stat steps of each PokÃ©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that PokÃ©mon can have based on their species. Most PokÃ©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"‹Abilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"‹Check your PokÃ©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy PokÃ©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"A PokÃ©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ƒMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A PokÃ©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ƒAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to PokÃ©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"Held items are items which you can give your PokÃ©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"†You can give a PokÃ©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."†Berries are a common held item. During battles, PokÃ©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your PokÃ©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a PokÃ©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In PokÃ©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild PokÃ©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"You will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"‰Status Conditions are ailments a PokÃ©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the PokÃ©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"‡Type immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"	Burn"Frostbite"Poison"™When poisoned, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."	Numb"
Dizzy"Leeched"–When leeched, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."
Sleep"A rarer status that causes a PokÃ©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put PokÃ©mon to sleep the most often."What are Enemy Trainers?"”Enemy Trainers are the PokÃ©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"”Trainers are people who have a companion PokÃ©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"ŸTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"³When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a PokÃ©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion PokÃ©mon to its PokÃ© Ball."Perfecting Fights"›If you defeat a Trainer without any of your PokÃ©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"›Enemy Trainers have their own teams of PokÃ©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"The typical trainer has 3 PokÃ©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more PokÃ©mon also have more move variety and more items on their PokÃ©mon."Pro Trainers"¯Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 PokÃ©mon, all with items and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"¤Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"ˆAvatars are powerful enemy PokÃ©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"€Effects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal PokÃ©mon."Primeval Moves"When a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"Before an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"›A targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"ŠSome Avatars have Empowered Moves, which are powered-up versions of damaging attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every PokÃ©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"“Legendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 PokÃ©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ PokÃ©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"‹Access the MasterDex entry of a single PokÃ©mon when looking at a PokÃ©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"—Access the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"œWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.

You lose a battle if that happens to your PokÃ©mon."’1. Have as many PokÃ©mon as you can. 2. Level up your PokÃ©mon as much as you can. 3. Abuse type matchups. 4. Start battles with healthy PokÃ©mon."Team Size"–You can have a maximum of 6 PokÃ©mon with you at any time. This is known as your 'Team'. You can store extra PokÃ©mon using the PC in any PokÃ©Center."Levels"©Each PokÃ©mon has a level from 1 to 70. A PokÃ©mon's level determines its stats as well as what moves it could learn. Reaching high enough levels also unlocks Evolution."Types are strong or weak against other types. Having a variety of different types on your team helps you take advantage of these relationships."Healing your PokÃ©mon"yHeal your PokÃ©mon at PokÃ©Centers between battles. You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time."Who goes first?"‰In battle, the PokÃ©mon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"¤Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"¥Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"«Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single PokÃ©mon, but many can target multiple PokÃ©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different PokÃ©mon based on those PokÃ©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"Learning Moves"ŠPokÃ©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every PokÃ©Center."Base Power"Moves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."Power Points"ŠPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a PokÃ©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."—Each PokÃ©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a PokÃ©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A PokÃ©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a PokÃ©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"ŠHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"’Barely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"¯Ineffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a PokÃ©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"‘The 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that PokÃ©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Why Get More?"Having choices of PokÃ©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"‹The two main methods of acquiring PokÃ©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"®Wild PokÃ©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these PokÃ©mon by throwing PokÃ© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"›Catching a PokÃ©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch PokÃ©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a PokÃ©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the PokÃ© Ball menu."Finding Wild PokÃ©mon"ªUse the DexNav to get information on which PokÃ©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more PokÃ©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"Throughout the world there will be people offering trades for PokÃ©mon. Usually they want a different PokÃ©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your PokÃ©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"ŠCheck your PokÃ©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the PokÃ©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"˜Your PokÃ©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"­Every species of PokÃ©mon have base stats, which affect every PokÃ©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"”Style Points are numbers which you can customize to change your PokÃ©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"…Your PokÃ©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When PokÃ©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"Stat Steps"“Effects can modify a PokÃ©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the PokÃ©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"Stat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the PokÃ©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"œYou can check the current stat steps of each PokÃ©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that PokÃ©mon can have based on their species. Most PokÃ©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"‹Abilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"‹Check your PokÃ©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy PokÃ©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"A PokÃ©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ƒMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A PokÃ©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ƒAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to PokÃ©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"Held items are items which you can give your PokÃ©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"†You can give a PokÃ©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."†Berries are a common held item. During battles, PokÃ©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your PokÃ©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a PokÃ©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In PokÃ©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild PokÃ©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"You will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"‰Status Conditions are ailments a PokÃ©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the PokÃ©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"‡Type immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"	Burn"Frostbite"Poison"™When poisoned, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."	Numb"
Dizzy"Leeched"–When leeched, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."
Sleep"A rarer status that causes a PokÃ©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put PokÃ©mon to sleep the most often."What are Enemy Trainers?"”Enemy Trainers are the PokÃ©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"”Trainers are people who have a companion PokÃ©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"ŸTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"³When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a PokÃ©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion PokÃ©mon to its PokÃ© Ball."Perfecting Fights"›If you defeat a Trainer without any of your PokÃ©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"›Enemy Trainers have their own teams of PokÃ©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"The typical trainer has 3 PokÃ©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more PokÃ©mon also have more move variety and more items on their PokÃ©mon."Pro Trainers"¯Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 PokÃ©mon, all with items and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"¤Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"ˆAvatars are powerful enemy PokÃ©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"€Effects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal PokÃ©mon."Primeval Moves"When a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"Before an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"›A targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"ŠSome Avatars have Empowered Moves, which are powered-up versions of damaging attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every PokÃ©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"“Legendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 PokÃ©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ PokÃ©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"‹Access the MasterDex entry of a single PokÃ©mon when looking at a PokÃ©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"—Access the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"œWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.
