0"ïSe le puede ver durmiendo la siesta a la luz del sol. Hay una semilla en su espalda. Al absorber los rayos del sol, la semilla crece progresivamente."íPara sostener su bulbo, sus patas crecen fuertes. Si pasa m√°s tiempo tumbado a la luz del sol, el capullo pronto se convertir√° en una gran flor."òSe dice que la flor de Venusaur adquiere colores vivos si recibe mucha nutrici√≥n y luz solar. El aroma de la flor alivia las emociones de las personas."ôLa llama que arde en la punta de su cola es una indicaci√≥n de sus emociones. La llama oscila cuando Charmander est√° feliz y arde cuando est√° enfadado."ïSus afiladas garras destruyen a los enemigos. Si se encuentra con un enemigo fuerte, se agita y la llama de su cola adquiere un color blanco azulado."åVuela en busca de oponentes fuertes. Exhala llamas intensas que pueden derretir cualquier material. Nunca quemar√° a un enemigo m√°s d√©bil."ûSu caparaz√≥n no es solo para protecci√≥n. Su forma redondeada y las ranuras minimizan la resistencia en el agua, lo que le permite nadar a altas velocidades."Su gran cola est√° cubierta con un pelaje rico y espeso. Los rasgu√±os en su caparaz√≥n son evidencia de su dureza  en combate."òLas trombas de agua que sobresalen de su caparaz√≥n son muy precisas. Sus balas de agua pueden clavar con precisi√≥n latas a m√°s de 48 m. de distancia."ÉSu apetito voraz lo obliga a devorar hojas m√°s grandes que √©l sin dudarlo. Desprende un olor terriblemente fuerte de sus antenas."ôSu caparaz√≥n es tan duro como una losa de hierro. No se mueve mucho porque est√° preparando sus suaves entra√±as para evolucionar dentro del caparaz√≥n."ÉTiene una habilidad superior para buscar miel de las flores. Puede buscar, extraer y transportar miel a m√°s de 10 Km de distancia."óTiene un sentido del olfato extremadamente agudo. Distingue sus tipos de hojas favoritas de las que no le gustan olfate√°ndolas con su gran nariz roja."ïPermanece inm√≥vil mientras se aferra a un √°rbol. Sin embargo, se prepara para la evoluci√≥n. Esto es evidente por lo caliente que es su caparaz√≥n."ëUn Beedrill es extremadamente territorial. Por razones de seguridad, nadie debe acercarse nunca a su nido. Si se enfada, atacar√° en un enjambre."ñTiene un sentido de la orientaci√≥n muy agudo. Puede regresar a casa a su nido infaliblemente, sin importar lo lejos que est√© de su entorno familiar."çVuela patrullando su gran territorio. Si se viola su espacio vital, no muestra piedad al castigar a fondo al enemigo con sus afiladas garras."óEste Pok√©mon tiene unas plumas preciosas. Muchos Entrenadores quedan tan cautivados por las plumas de su cabeza que eligen a Pidgeot como su Pok√©mon."íEs extremadamente cauteloso. Incluso cuando est√° dormido, mueve constantemente las orejas y escucha el peligro. Har√° su nido en cualquier lugar."åSus robustos colmillos crecen constantemente. Para mantenerlos firmes, roe rocas y troncos. Incluso puede masticar las paredes de las casas."öSu grito se puede escuchar a m√°s de 8 Km. Si su agudo grito se escucha resonando por todas partes, es una se√±al de que est√°n advirtiendo de un peligro."öSu cuello largo y pico alargado son ideales para atrapar presas en el suelo o el agua. Mueve h√°bilmente este pico alargado y delgado para atrapar presas."öSe enrosca en espiral mientras descansa. Esta posici√≥n le permite responder r√°pidamente a un enemigo desde cualquier direcci√≥n con la cabeza levantada."öTiene un poder de constricci√≥n muy fuerte. Incluso puede aplastar bidones de acero. Una vez que se enrosca alrededor de su enemigo, escapar es imposible."óAlmacena electricidad en las bolsas de sus mejillas. Cuando libera energ√≠a reprimida en un estallido, la energ√≠a el√©ctrica es igual a la de un rayo."îSi almacena demasiada electricidad, su comportamiento se vuelve agresivo. Para evitarlo, de vez en cuando descarga el exceso de energ√≠a y se calma."ìCuando se enrosca en una bola, hace que cualquier ataque rebote sin causar da√±o. Su piel se ha vuelto dura y s√≥lida como al vivir en el desierto."õSe enrosca en una bola para protegerse de los ataques enemigos. Tambi√©n para evitar un golpe de calor durante el d√≠a cuando las temperaturas suben mucho."ïSe cree que sus p√∫as altamente t√≥xicas se desarrollaron como protecci√≥n de su peque√±o cuerpo. Cuando se enfurece, libera una toxina de su cuerno."àCuando est√° con sus amigos o familiares, sus p√∫as se guardan para evitar lesiones. Parece ponerse nervioso si se separa de los dem√°s."ìEs experto en enviar a los enemigos por los aires con duros placajes usando su cuerpo duro y escamoso. Es m√°s fuerte cuando defiende a sus cr√≠as."ùHa desarrollado m√∫sculos que mueven libremente sus orejas en cualquier direcci√≥n. Incluso el m√°s m√≠nimo sonido no escapa a la atenci√≥n de este Pok√©mon."êSu cuerno es m√°s duro que un diamante. Si detecta una presencia hostil, todas las p√∫as de su espalda se erizan a la vez y desaf√≠a a su rival."ôSu cola gruesa contiene un poder destructivo capaz de derribar una torre de transmisi√≥n de metal. Una vez que se vuelve loco, no hay forma de detenerlo."íTodas las noches de luna llena, salen a jugar. Cuando llega el amanecer, se van a dormir acurrucados unos contra otros en las monta√±as profundas."úUsa sus alas para dar saltitos como si estuviera volando.

Healing at a Pok√©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."óEach Pok√©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a Pok√©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A Pok√©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a Pok√©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"äHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"íBarely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"ØIneffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a Pok√©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"ëThe 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that Pok√©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Why Get More?"ùHaving choices of Pok√©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"ãThe two main methods of acquiring Pok√©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"ÆWild Pok√©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pok√©mon by throwing Pok√© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"õCatching a Pok√©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pok√©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a Pok√©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Pok√© Ball menu."Finding Wild Pok√©mon"™Use the DexNav to get information on which Pok√©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more Pok√©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"éThroughout the world there will be people offering trades for Pok√©mon. Usually they want a different Pok√©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your Pok√©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"äCheck your Pok√©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the Pok√©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"òYour Pok√©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"HP"Style Points"îStyle Points are numbers which you can customize to change your Pok√©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"ÖYour Pok√©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When Pok√©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"Stat Steps"ìEffects can modify a Pok√©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the Pok√©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"éStat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the Pok√©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"úYou can check the current stat steps of each Pok√©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that Pok√©mon can have based on their species. Most Pok√©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"ãAbilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"ãCheck your Pok√©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy Pok√©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"êA Pok√©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"Many abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A Pok√©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ÉAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to Pok√©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"êHeld items are items which you can give your Pok√©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"ÜYou can give a Pok√©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."ÜBerries are a common held item. During battles, Pok√©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Oran Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Oran Berry are common berries which heal your Pok√©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a Pok√©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In Pok√©mon Tectonic, the rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild Pok√©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"ûYou will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"âStatus Conditions are ailments a Pok√©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the Pok√©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"áType immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"	Burn"Frostbite"{1} is eager for more!"òWhen poisoned, a Pok√©mon loses 1/8th HP every turn. This doubles every 3 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."	Numb"
Dizzy"Leeched"ïWhen leeched, a Pok√©mon loses 1/8th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."
Sleep"çA rarer status that causes a Pok√©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put Pok√©mon to sleep the most often."What are Enemy Trainers?"îEnemy Trainers are the Pok√©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"îTrainers are people who have a companion Pok√©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"üTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"≥When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a Pok√©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion Pok√©mon to its Pok√© Ball."Perfecting Fights"õIf you defeat a Trainer without any of your Pok√©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"öEnemy Trainers have their own teams of Pok√©mon with their own moves and held items. Its important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"ùThe typical trainer has 3 Pok√©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more Pok√©mon also have more move variety and more items on their Pok√©mon."Pro Trainers"≠Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 Pok√©mon, with a wide variety of moves, all with items. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"§Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"àAvatars are powerful enemy Pok√©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"uAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Usually more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"ÄEffects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal Pok√©mon."Primeval Moves"ùWhen a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"èBefore an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"°Avatars usually attack your healthiest Pok√©mon. However, they will sometimes attack your lower health Pok√©mon. This is more common when the Avatar is also low."Empowered Moves"èSome Avatars also have Empowered Moves, which are powered-up versions of damaging attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every Pok√©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"ìLegendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 Pok√©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ Pok√©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"ãAccess the MasterDex entry of a single Pok√©mon when looking at a Pok√©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"ñAccess the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while its waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"úWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.

Only one weather can be active at once."Weather Duration"¢Weathers last a certain number of turns. The length differs depending on what move or ability summoned the weather. The duration can be extended by certain items."Sunshine"	Rain"Sandstorm"	Hail"Eclipse"Moonglow"Frostbitten"ìEach weather has both an upside and a downside. There are items and abilities that make your Pok√©mon immune to these downsides regardless of type."Weather Areas"õCertain areas in the game experience intense weather. That weather will also be present in the battles of that area. Simple daily weather will not do this."Weather Synergies"¢Each weather has dozens of moves and abilities that benefit from that weather.
